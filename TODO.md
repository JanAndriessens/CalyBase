  - Edit (Modifier) buttons only show when permissions are successfully granted
  
- [x] **Enhanced permission error handling**
  - Added graceful fallbacks for permission system timeouts
  - Improved debugging with detailed console logging
  - Protected against Firebase initialization delays

### 📋 Deployment Pipeline Setup - Tomorrow's Tasks:

#### **Current Status:**
- Local repository: `/Users/jan/Documents/GitHub/CalyBase`
- Vercel project: `vercel.com/h2m/caly-base` (project ID: `prj_lEeGELeI6rlFWYyF1NVMNEcsDSWa`)
- All code changes committed locally and ready to deploy

#### **Next Steps for GitHub Desktop + Vercel Setup:**

1. **Add Existing Project to GitHub Desktop**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Add existing repository: `/Users/jan/Documents/GitHub/CalyBase`
